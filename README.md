# Day-by-Day-Social

## Description

- My motivation for building this application was to utilise mongoDB and mongoose to create a social media application that allows users to post their thoughts and react to other users thoughts.
- I built this project to learn more about mongoDB and mongoose. I also wanted to learn more about relationships between models and how to use them.
- This application allows users to create an account, post their thoughts, react to other users thoughts and add other users as friends. It is an API application so it is not deployed to a live server. It can be used with Insomnia Core or Postman.
- I learn't a lot more about mongoDB and mongoose, I learn't how it differs from MySQL and Sequelize. I also learn't how to use relationships between models and how to use them to create a more complex application.


## Installation

- To install this application you will need to clone the repository to your local machine. You will also need to install node.js and mongoDB.

## Usage

- To use this application you will need to run npm install to install the dependencies. You will also need to run npm start to start the server. You can then use Insomnia Core or Postman to test the routes.
